## ðŸ“„ Supporting Documentation

This repository includes three key supporting documents related to the development and testing of the automated grading algorithm:

### 1. Appendix P â€“ Algorithm Replication of Original Rubric

Demonstrates how the algorithm successfully recreated the original structured rubric for a known open-ended question, including evaluation criteria, scoring logic, and decision tables.

---

### 2. Appendix R â€“ Algorithm Applied to a New Question

Shows the application of the algorithm to a completely new question and rubric, confirming its ability to generalize and generate consistent evaluation outputs across different contexts.

---

### 3. GPT-4o Limitations with the Algorithm

Documents early tests using GPT-4o, where the model struggled to follow long instructions and failed to retain the full grading protocol. These limitations affected its performance when running the algorithm and motivated the switch to GPT-o1, which showed better consistency and instruction-following capabilities.
